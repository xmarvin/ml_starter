== README

I was interested how to machine learning such as image recognition in Ruby on Rails.
My quick search gave me no results, and I decided to create some template to start

* Setup

1) > bundle install
2) We need python and ml libraries
   > pip install tensorflow
   > pip install keras

3)  We need cache trained weights for neural net and verify it works
    > python ./ml/xcpetion.py


* Run
    Firstly we need to start python service:
    > python ./ml/service.py
    > rails s
